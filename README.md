# DCS Keycaps

3D Models for rendering the DCS keycap profile.

Blank DCS and Gorton Modified Legends (the most common) are available in STEP and OBJ file formats.

### Updates: ###

#### October 15th, 2021: ####
Added a selection of Norde/International legend keycaps and some for 40% keyboards. 
Added R1-R4 relegendable keycaps. (These are just approximate until I have samples on hand).

#### August 19th, 2021: ####
**Download again!** Made ALL keycaps more accurate for final version. (The only new updates from now on would be more legends or special keys.) Also added more keycaps with legends. 

#### July 28th, 2021: ####
Fixed all STEP and OBJ Gorton Modified files uploaded with the wrong geometry. (sorry about that) Added many more keycaps and R1 Re-legendables.

I've tried to make these as accurate as possible, even making them thin DCS instead of thick (don't hate me), but they may be off to a small degree. Use at your own risk (if any.)

So far I have only provided the most popular keycap sizes per row. There are a few more in the Signature Plastics DCS family, but rarely used on modern keyboards so I have choosen to omit them at this time.
