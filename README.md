I've tried to make these as accurate as possible, but they may be off to a small degree. Use at your own risk (if any).

So far I have only provided the most popular keycap sizes per row. There are a few more in the Signature Plastics DCS family, but rarely used on modern keyboards so I have choosen to omit them at this time.
