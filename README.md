I've tried to make these as accurate as possible, even making them thin DCS instead of thick (don't hate me), but they may be off to a small degree. Use at your own risk (if any.)

So far I have only provided the most popular keycap sizes per row. There are a few more in the Signature Plastics DCS family, but rarely used on modern keyboards so I have choosen to omit them at this time.
