# DCS_keycaps

3D Models for rendering the DCS keycap profile.
Blanks and Gorton Modified Legends (the most common) are available in STEP and OBJ file formats.

### Update ###
July 28th, 2021: #Download again!# Fixed all STEP and OBJ Gorton Modified files with the wrong geometry. (sorry about that) Added many more keycaps and R1 Re-legendables.

### Row Profiles:

### Available R4 Spacebar Sizes:

I've tried to make these as accurate as possible, even making them thin DCS instead of thick (don't hate me), but they may be off to a small degree. Use at your own risk (if any.)

So far I have only provided the most popular keycap sizes per row. There are a few more in the Signature Plastics DCS family, but rarely used on modern keyboards so I have choosen to omit them at this time.

### Available Keycap Legends Per Row: ###
